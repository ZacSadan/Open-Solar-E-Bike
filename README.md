# Open-Solar-E-Bike
## Free Green Transportation Design for Everyone

The aim is to create free blueprint+instructions for building a simple, **attractive-looking**, and of course **legal**, two-passenger **solar e-bike**, with **100% green charging** and transportation abilities.

The blueprints and instructions will enable any **non-technical person** to build the bike at home with a screwdriver, saw and drill (and his/her own materials), for **under 1000$**. 

We believe that a green solar e-bike can make our world a better place, providing better mobility for both developed and developing countries, and directly **affect the environment and economy**.
